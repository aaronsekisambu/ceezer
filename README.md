# The Pokémon API Frontend Coding Challenge

# The Application

The application should provide us basic browsing and discover features. It’s all about the function. Design is not the highest priority in this part.

### List All Pokemons

Please list all Pokemons with a short summary of each on the root page of the application.

### Start then app

### `Run yarn and the yarn dev`

## Approach

Pokemon has lots of cards, so I limited it to 20 cardds and them loaded this in the local state of the component. Then looped through each card to get the different cards. With this, I have all the details of the card,
So when you click on the card, you will get the other details without making another call
